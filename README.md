## Sparse SLAM
### TODO:
    0. Frame processing module
    1. Feature detection
    2. Feature matching
    3. Estimate the essential matrix
    4. Estimate the pose of the camera
    5. Project image coordinates to 3d points
    6. Full bundle adjustment.
        - Research how this is used in context of SLAM (local vs global bundle adjustment)
